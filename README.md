# usb-attacker
This project uses Raspberry Pi Zero W ("W" version required only for wireless activation - the idea is also compatible with other OTG ready microcontrollers/SoCs) to attack a connected device using HID protocol - it allows to upload disk contents (example in the repo), install a keylogger (example in the repo) or other tools either via remote or time activation.
